/*
** We design the buddy system so that blocks of size 2^n always
*  begin at memory addresses where the n least significant bits are zero.
** For instance:
**   - n = 0, blocks can begin at any address.
**   - n = 1, blocks can only begin at even addresses.
**   - n = 2, blocks can only begin at addresses with
*        the least significant 2 bits equal to zero.
** So when a block of size 2n+1 is split
** into two blocks of size 2n, the addresses of these two blocks will differ
** in exactly one bit, bit n, using the counting scheme that
** numbers bits starting with 0 at the least significant end.
*Thus, given a block of size 2n at address a,
*we can compute the address of its buddy, the other half of the block from which it was split, by exclusive-oring a with 2n. **
